# ADDA-Labs

My proposed solutions for the lab exercises of my Data Structures and Algorithms course at Universidad de Sevilla. 

All exercises uploaded here have been tested and work correctly, giving a solution, not necessarily the optimal one.

Warning: In this repository I provide only the core files, omitting some other folders and files available in the template project.
In order to run it in your computer, I suggest starting with the template and then changing all necessary files. Make sure to import correctly the dependencies

To work with recursive data types, graphs, linear programming, and genetic algorithms, I make use of the repository adda_v4, written by Miguel Toro Bonilla.
